=============
WebM for bakas. Basically, a wrapper around ffmpeg made for converting videos to WebM without having to use the command line.

Don't run ffmpeg.exe you baka, run WebMConverter.exe.
And I shouldn't have to tell you to extract the zip file first.
Also, don't click "Download ZIP" on the right side of the page, that'll only download the source. (unless you want to compile it yourself, obviously)

Important to know:
* Requires .NET Framework 4.0 (Windows 7 comes with 3.5, so you might want to update)

This software is released under the MIT license. See [LICENSE.md] (https://github.com/WebMBro/WebMConverter/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
